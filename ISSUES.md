# Known issues

Non-blocking findings, newest first. Blocking findings never land here — they go back to the
analysis stage. Each entry says why it was judged not worth stopping for, and when it will start to
matter.

## 2026-09-02 — physical test of the slice 1 rework (cycle 2), PR 1

The real binary driven over stdin and stdout: the dispatch cap at both sides of its boundary,
survival across repeated refusals, a full ordinary session, the committed replay fixture, `npm run
check` from cold and both CI jobs. All green, and PR 1 merged into `agent/develop`. One observation,
surfaced only because this stage spoke the protocol instead of calling the modules.

### `marker.place` neither places nor reports placing

- **It is a move-to-absolute on a marker that must already exist.** `packages/sim/src/marker.ts`
  looks the id up first and answers `{"status":"rejected","reason":"unknown-marker"}` when it is
  absent, so `marker.place` against any id the scenario did not spawn is refused — the
  `marker-field` scenario spawns exactly one, id 1. It then emits `marker.moved`, not a placement
  event. Both testers guessed creation from the name and had a command rejected before they read the
  source.

  **Not blocking, and not a defect.** The behaviour is correct, internally consistent and covered by
  the suite; only the name points the wrong way. What it costs is a wrong first guess from every
  future client author, paid again each time. What it will cost later: slice 2 adds a real command
  set and inherits this vocabulary, so the misnomer either gets fixed there or becomes the
  convention.

  **Why it was not fixed here.** The name is baked into
  `packages/fixtures/replays/marker-drift.json`, so renaming it to something honest —
  `marker.moveTo` — is a protocol change plus a re-recorded fixture, not a rename. That belongs with
  slice 2's command-set decisions, alongside the selector pinning recorded in the cycle 2 review
  entry below, as the other cheap improvement waiting for slice 1 to reopen.

## 2026-09-02 — independent review of the slice 1 rework (cycle 2), PR 1

Four lenses over commits `bfaeaec` and `24e78b8`. No blocking findings; the three repairs hold and
every guard was independently re-broken. What follows is everything judged not worth stopping for,
plus one correction that matters more than the rest of the list.

### The premise that was wrong

- **readline assembles an unbounded input line, and the process dies before either containment layer
  can see it.** Measured against the real binary: the harness answered `session.new`, then received
  ~512 MB of the byte `a` with no newline and no JSON validity, and exited — `RangeError: Invalid
  string length` on a default heap, and under `--max-old-space-size=256` a `FATAL ERROR: Reached heap
  limit`, exit 134, which is an abort no `catch` can reach. Reproduced independently during the
  review. The accumulation happens inside `createInterface` (`packages/harness/src/server.ts:15`),
  before the `line` event that `answer` wraps, so neither layer added this cycle applies.

  **This is not a finding against the rework.** `createInterface` has been there since `8c3d314`, the
  diff neither introduced nor worsened it, and the requirement the task set — that no *well-formed
  request* can end the process, and that a serialisation failure becomes an answer — is met and was
  verified. It is recorded here because it **falsifies a premise this cycle wrote down twice**: both
  decision 31 and the echo-paths entry below justified leaving other paths uncapped on the grounds
  that such a request line "could not have been assembled". It can be. Those two sentences are now
  corrected rather than left to mislead the next cycle.

  What it costs: the harness is killable by a client that writes bytes without a newline, taking every
  open session with it. What would fix it: a maximum input line length enforced as bytes arrive, which
  is the same shape of decision as the session and snapshot eviction policy already deferred to slice
  2, and belongs with it rather than bolted onto a serialisation repair.

- **`sim.dispatch` was not "the only amplifier".** `sim.step` returns 5,826,153 bytes for an 85-byte
  request — 68,543x, against dispatch's 2.02x at the new cap. It is survivable because
  `MAX_EVENTS_PER_RESPONSE` hard-bounds it, so decision 31's *conclusion* stands and no cap is needed;
  only its stated reasoning was too narrow.

### Bounds and stalls, measured rather than estimated

- **`replay.verify`'s quadratic rescan, timed.** `dispatchIssuedAt` (`packages/harness/src/replay.ts:63`)
  rescans the whole command list per tick. 100,000 commands at tick 0 plus one checkpoint at tick
  1,000,000 — every value inside its documented cap — blocked the harness for **8 min 4 s**, answering
  nothing for any session. This confirms the entry already recorded below and replaces its estimate
  with a measurement.
- **A refusal that has already advanced the session.** `sim.runUntil` calls
  `refuseBeyondEventBudget` after `sim.step(1)` has run (`packages/harness/src/methods/sim.ts:88-92`),
  so a `limit-exceeded` leaves the session 100,001 ticks further on with no `ticksStepped` in the
  response. Only the caller's own session, and it stays internally consistent. The `sim.step` sibling
  is already recorded below; `runUntil` is the reachable one.

### The purity gate, past what it now guards

- **The binding test pins one file, not the glob.** It proves the rules reach
  `packages/sim/src/index.ts`. Narrowing the glob to exactly that file leaves every other sim source
  unguarded with all 59 tests green. It upgrades "any glob change" to "any glob change that still
  matches index.ts" — a real improvement, short of the "closes the gap permanently" the analysis
  claimed.
- **`assert.equal(selectors.length, 4)` catches deletion but not garbling.** Mutating
  `NewExpression[callee.name='Date']` to `callee.name='Datte'` leaves all eight purity tests green —
  the same defect class as the dead `TSImportType` selector this cycle found by hand. Decision 35
  declined to pin selector spellings because doing so would have cemented the typo; **that reason
  expired the moment repair 3 landed.** Pinning the four selector strings, in the `includes` style the
  sibling assertions already use, strictly dominates the count: it catches deletion and garbling both,
  and fails loudly on the next typescript-eslint major instead of going silently dead. This is the
  cheapest real improvement on the list.
- **`severityAsNumber` will fail a valid future rule.** Its non-array branch returns the value
  untouched, so a rule declared as `eqeqeq: 'error'` prints `[2]` and compares against `'error'` —
  a spurious failure on a correct config, contradicting decision 32's "no test maintenance" claim.
  Normalising both sides to array form is one line.
- **The custom message strings are untested prose.** Rewriting them to nonsense leaves all eight
  purity tests green; the binding test compares the config to itself and the fixtures match only
  ESLint's generated prefixes.

### Tidy-ups

- `printedConfigFor` JSON-parses stdout and stderr concatenated, so any warning on stderr would
  surface as a syntax error that reads like a config fault. Parsing stdout alone is safer.
- `answers()` in `containment.test.ts` re-implements `readResponses` from `client.ts` — but buffers
  lines the older one drops, so it is the better implementation and the natural seed for the
  `client.ts` fix already recorded below.
- The `JSON.stringify` stub restores in a `finally`, which does not run if a body hangs rather than
  throws. Contained today only because the affected test is last in its file — an ordering dependency
  nobody wrote down. A `t.after()` restore removes it.
- The containment test never tears down `serve`, its two `createInterface`s or its `PassThrough`s.
- Two coverage gaps in decision 30's own guarantees: nothing asserts the fallback message is a
  *literal* rather than `String(cause)`, and `MAX_ECHOED_ID_LENGTH` is exercised at 257 but not at its
  256 boundary, so an off-by-one would pass.
- `echoableId` bounds `id.length` in UTF-16 code units, so 128 astral characters pass a 256 check and
  serialise to ~1 KB — above decision 30's "under about 400 bytes". No failure mode.
- `optionalArray` (`packages/harness/src/params.ts:74`) now has no callers.

## 2026-09-02 — analysis of the cycle 1 review findings (cycle 2)

Found while prototyping the two repairs. None of them blocks that work.

### Resources nothing bounds

- **`SessionRegistry` caps neither sessions per process nor snapshots per session.** `snapshot.take` in a loop grows the heap without limit, and so does opening sessions. This is resource exhaustion rather than response size, so the containment layers added this cycle do not help — an OOM kill is not a throw anything can catch. It is out of scope here because it is a different failure mode from the one under repair and needs its own decision about eviction policy, which slice 2's session lifetime work is the natural place for. Worth a ticket of its own rather than an entry here if it is still open by then.
- **The echo paths are unbounded but cannot currently overflow.** `replay.verify` echoes `expectedHash` verbatim, and the `method-unknown`, `scenario-unknown` and `pointer-unknown` messages echo the offending name. All are 1x or smaller, so a response cannot exceed the maximum string length unless the request line already did. **The clause that once followed here — that readline could not have assembled such a line — was false, and is corrected in the cycle 2 review entry above.** A `MAX_ECHOED_STRING_LENGTH` truncation inside `RpcError` message construction would cover all of them at once and is the obvious belt-and-braces, but there is no reachable failure to justify it today.

### The last unguarded throw

- **`output.write` throwing inside the line listener's catch still escapes.** The containment added this cycle wraps the handler, not the write that reports its failure. A failing write to stdout means the peer is already gone, so there is nothing left to answer and nowhere to report it — wrapping it a second time buys a quieter exit, not a working one. Recorded so the next person does not read the containment as absolute.

### Tidy-ups the repair deliberately did not take

- **The gate suite now has two fixture sets and two `files` blocks where one would do.** The `tests/gates/fixtures` block exists only so the negative tests can probe the purity rules from outside the sim, and that separation is precisely what allowed the rules to be detached from `packages/sim/src` with every test still green. With the binding assertion in place the redundancy is harmless, so consolidating — a single fixture living under the real glob, and the second `files` block deleted — was rejected as churn at cycle 2 of a ceiling of 3. It is the right end state once the slice has landed.
- **Neither the binding test nor a fixture proves a rule's selector still matches the parser's AST.** The dead `TSImportType` selector fixed this cycle was invisible to both: the binding test compares the config to itself, and no fixture exercised that rule. The general defence is a fixture per rule under the real glob, which is more machinery than the risk currently justifies. Revisit on the next typescript-eslint major, which is when selector fields move.

## 2026-09-02 — review of PR 1 rework (slice 1, cycle 1)

Found by the four review lenses on the rework. Two blocking findings went back to analysis; these did
not meet the blocking test. The gate and bounds entries below are all *narrower* holes than the two
that blocked — recorded so the next person does not have to rediscover them.

### The purity gates, past the naive spelling

The gates now catch every violation cycle 0 demonstrated. These are the routes they still miss. None
is the plain documented case, which is why none blocked.

- **Dynamic `import()` through a variable escapes the import gate.** `const p = '../../harness/src/json.ts'; await import(p)` passes both `imports` and `lint`. Statically undecidable; the literal and concatenated forms are both caught. Only worth revisiting if the sim ever legitimately needs dynamic import, which it should not.
- **A symlinked directory inside `packages/sim/src` defeats both gates.** `sourceFiles` in `tools/check-sim-imports.ts` treats a symlink as a non-directory, so `export { isRecord } from './linked/json.ts'` through a junction is invisible. Demonstrated. Nobody creates one by accident; it matters only if a build step ever starts linking directories into the sim.
- **A non-`.ts` extension inside `packages/sim/src` is invisible to every gate.** A `.mts` or `.cts` file importing `node:fs` passes `imports` and `lint`, and tsc's `src/**/*.ts` glob does not match it either. Starts to matter the moment anything in the repo emits a non-`.ts` file into that directory.
- **The import gate is a regex over file text, so specifier-shaped strings are false positives.** A comment containing `from 'node:fs'`, or a string constant holding an import statement, fails the gate with a misleading diagnostic. It fails safe rather than open, which is the right direction, but it will read as a mystery build break the first time it happens.
- **The dependency gate reads four manifest fields, not seven.** `bundledDependencies`, `bundleDependencies`, `overrides` and `resolutions` all pass, and npm honours all four. Adding them is a one-line change to `FORBIDDEN_FIELDS`; it was left because no workflow here writes those fields today.
- **Nondeterministic globals never enumerated.** `setImmediate`, `queueMicrotask`, `Intl`, `navigator`, `fetch`, `structuredClone`, `eval` / `new Function`, and `Reflect.get(Math, 'random')()` all lint clean in sim source. `structuredClone` is the notable one — the stack decision avoids it as a host global, but no rule stops it. The determinism test remains the backstop for all of these.

### Replay, at the edges

- **`replay.verify` is O(lastTick x commands), and both factors are capped independently.** `dispatchIssuedAt` rescans the whole command list once per tick. A request inside every documented cap — 100000 commands with one at tick 1000000 — occupies the harness for somewhere between nine and twenty-one minutes of saturated CPU, memory flat. Nothing is corrupted and the process recovers, so this is latency with no stated budget rather than the availability failure that blocked. But the harness is single-threaded, so one such request stalls every session. Indexing commands by tick into a `Map` before the loop removes it entirely, and that is the right fix when someone touches this next.
- **A request within both array caps can fail with `internal-error` instead of succeeding.** `lastTickOf` uses `Math.max(0, ...commandTicks, ...trailTicks)`; past roughly 125000 spread arguments V8 throws `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`, which surfaces as `-32603`. Measured: `commands` 100000 plus `hashTrail` 30000 trips it, both under `MAX_REPLAY_ENTRIES`. It is caught and the process survives, so it is a wrong error code rather than a crash — but it contradicts decision 16's intent that well-formed-but-too-large be actionable. A reduce instead of a spread fixes it.
- **Duplicate `hashTrail` checkpoints silently last-win.** `new Map(run.hashTrail.map(...))` means a trail carrying both a wrong and a correct hash for the same tick verifies `ok:true` when the correct one comes last. It cannot mask genuine divergence — the winning duplicate must carry the true hash — so it only lets a self-contradictory trail pass, and no well-formed recorder emits one.
- **`replay.verify` ignores `scenario`.** The fixture stores `"scenario": "marker-field"` and the recorder honours it, but `verifyReplay` calls `Sim.create({ seed })` directly rather than `createScenarioSim`. Harmless while `marker-field` is the only scenario and the default; silently wrong the day slice 2 adds a second one. Worth fixing with the first new scenario, not before.
- **`lastTickOf` is written twice**, in `packages/harness/src/replay.ts` and `tools/record-replay.ts`, with identical bodies and no test pinning either. The rule defining how long a replay runs lives in two places; if they drift, the recorder and the verifier disagree about the run length. It resolves itself when the ndjson client moves somewhere both can import, which `ISSUES.md` already anticipates for slice 2.

### Test coverage the rework left open

- **Nothing pins the *final* checkpoint of a replay.** The committed tests corrupt a middle checkpoint only, and the fixture's last command sits at tick 7 of 12. Consequently a verifier mutated to loop `tick < lastTick` instead of `tick <= lastTick` passes all 53 tests, while a corrupted final checkpoint and an extra command on the final tick both return `ok:true`. The shipped verifier is correct; it is the test suite that does not hold it there. One assertion on the final checkpoint closes it, and this is the single highest-value test to add.
- **`MAX_TICKS_PER_RUN` is unreachable in practice and its test does not exercise the cap.** With one marker the event budget aborts any run past 100001 ticks, so the run cap can never fire. The test that reads as pinning the boundary passes because `equals: 0` matches at tick 0 and no ticks are stepped. Slice 2 changes the arithmetic; the test should be made real then.

### Corrections to entries recorded this cycle

Both of these are entries added by the rework that are narrower or wider than what the code does. The
code is right; the note is wrong.

- **"The event budget is unreachable through the protocol today" is not correct.** `sim.runUntil` with `pointer: "/tick"`, `equals: -1` and `maxTicks: 100001` returns `limit-exceeded: a request may emit at most 100000 events` today. A genuine rejection test is writable now, not in slice 2.
- **"No purity rule survives local aliasing" is wider than the truth.** `no-restricted-globals` fires on the reference itself, so `const P = process; P.pid` *is* caught, as are `const { random } = Math` and `Math['random']()`. Only a restricted *property* reached through a local object binding — `const M = Math; M.random()` — survives. The recorded limit is real but applies to one rule family, not to every rule.

## 2026-09-02 — rework of PR 1 (slice 1, cycle 1)

Found while fixing the five blocking findings. None of these blocked the fix.

### The limits of a lint rule

- **No purity rule survives local aliasing.** `const M = Math; M.random()` passes
  `no-restricted-properties`, and the same trick defeats every restricted global now that
  `globalThis` itself is banned. ESLint reasons about spellings, not values, so this is not fixable
  by adding more entries to the list — only a type-aware or dataflow rule would catch it, which is a
  disproportionate amount of machinery for the risk. The determinism test in
  `tests/sim/determinism.test.ts` is the real backstop: an aliased nondeterministic call makes the
  same seed produce a different hash, and that test fails. Worth revisiting only if a real
  nondeterminism bug ever gets through.

### Bounds, at the edges

- **A step that trips the event budget leaves the session partially advanced.** `stepWithinEventBudget`
  (`packages/harness/src/methods/sim.ts`) mutates as it goes, so a request refused with
  `limit-exceeded` has already moved the clock. The caller can read the true `tick` back and carry on,
  but the failed call is not atomic. Inherent to enforcing the budget outside `Sim.step`, which
  decision 15 chose deliberately to keep `packages/sim` pure. It starts to matter if an agent ever
  relies on a failed request having changed nothing — snapshot and restore is the answer there.
- **The event budget is unreachable through the protocol today.** One marker means events equal ticks,
  so `MAX_TICKS_PER_STEP` always fires first and `MAX_EVENTS_PER_RESPONSE` cannot be tripped by any
  request. The test pins the boundary at the accepting side rather than proving a rejection. Slice 2
  multiplies markers and makes it reachable; the rejection path should get a real test then.

### Layering

- **`tools/record-replay.ts` imports `tests/harness/client.ts`**, so a tool depends on a test helper.
  It was done so the committed fixture and the round-trip test are produced by the same code path,
  which is the point of the acceptance criterion, and duplicating the recording loop to avoid it would
  be worse. The clean fix is to move the ndjson client to a place both can import — a `packages/client`
  or `tools/lib` — which is a slice 2 concern once more tooling needs it.

## 2026-09-02 — review of PR 1 (slice 1, simulation core and harness)

Five blocking findings were returned to analysis. The rest are recorded here.

### Robustness, latent today

- **`Sim.state` is only shallowly readonly** (`packages/sim/src/sim.ts:32`). `sim.state.markers[0].x = 99`
  and `sim.state.rngStreams['marker.drift'] = ...` both typecheck under strict mode and do mutate the
  live state — verified, the hash moves. Nothing in the codebase does this today, and nothing can
  reach it over RPC because responses are serialised. It becomes a real hazard once more systems hold
  a `Sim` reference. A deep readonly type, or handing out a clone, would close it.

- **`deserialise` validates nothing beyond `schemaVersion`** (`packages/sim/src/save.ts:15-38`). A save
  with `"tick": 0.5`, a missing `markers` array, or a string in an RNG cursor loads without complaint
  and then fails much later and far away — `hash()` throws on the non-integer, `step()` throws inside
  the RNG. Not reachable today: no harness method calls `Sim.load`. **This must be fixed before slice 4
  wires save and load into the game loop**, because at that point a corrupt save becomes a user-facing
  data-loss path rather than a library hazard.

- **`nextIntInRange` never terminates for a span of 2^32 or more** (`packages/sim/src/rng.ts:38-40`).
  `UINT32_SPAN % span` equals `UINT32_SPAN` at that size, so the debias limit is 0 and every draw is
  rejected forever. The only call site today asks for a range of 3. It is a trap for slice 2's puzzle
  code, and the existing guard only rejects an empty range.

- **Sessions are never evicted** (`packages/harness/src/sessions.ts:19`). A long-lived harness process
  accumulates sessions and snapshots. Fine at present scale.

- **Error messages echo the full caller-supplied value** (`scenarios.ts:14`, `rpc.ts:57`,
  `pointer.ts:30`). An 80 MB scenario name produced an 83 MB error line. A length cap on echoed values
  would cost nothing.

### Test coverage

Mutation testing found that 16 of 36 deliberate breakages went undetected. The code was separately
verified correct, so these are coverage gaps rather than defects — but they are the gaps the next two
slices lean on hardest.

- **`nextUint32` has no direct test.** Every RNG assertion observes it through `draw % 3`, and 3
  divides 2^32 − 1, so the modulus is provably blind to the rotation direction: inverting the rotate in
  `rng.ts:67` leaves all 37 tests passing. Slices 2 and 3 draw ranges of 6, 7 and 52, where it would
  not hide. A committed golden vector of raw `nextUint32` draws fixes this permanently.
- **No test that two named streams are independent** — only `marker.drift` ever exists. Slice 2 and
  slice 3 each want their own stream.
- **The debias loop and the empty-range guard in `nextIntInRange` are untested** (3 surviving mutants).
- **`restore` aliasing instead of cloning is not caught**, because no test restores the same snapshot
  twice. That is exactly the branch-and-compare workflow the skill recommends.
- **`jsonPatch` array add and remove are dead code today** (`packages/harness/src/patch.ts:39-48`)
  because `markers` never changes length. Slice 3 spawns and sinks ships, and `state.diff` is the
  agent's main observation channel.
- **The migration tests are circular** (`tests/sim/migration.test.ts:6-10`): the "v1 save" is
  manufactured by taking a current save and relabelling `schemaVersion`, so an identity migration is
  indistinguishable from a real one. When slice 2 adds a field to `WorldState` the test will still
  pass without exercising a migration. A committed v1 save fixture under `packages/fixtures/saves/`
  would make it a real test. Related: the changelog justified `SCHEMA_VERSION = 2` as giving "a real
  1→2 migration"; the registered migration is the identity function.
- **`takeEntityId` is exercised with exactly one entity**; multi-entity spawn is untested.
- **JSON Pointer escaping (`~0`, `~1`) and object depth truncation have no tests** (3 surviving
  mutants) even though the implementation is RFC-correct.

### Maintainability

- **`tests/harness/client.ts` correlates responses by arrival order, not by JSON-RPC id**
  (`:35`, `:39`). That is why a mutant returning `id: null` for every response survived, and it means a
  blank input line leaves a resolver pending forever and shifts every later response by one. There is
  also no timeout, so a harness crash hangs the run instead of failing it. Slice 2 should swap the FIFO
  for an id-keyed map and make `call` generic before building on it.
- **The command shape is written twice** — the `Command` union in `packages/sim/src/commands.ts` and a
  hand-written switch in `packages/harness/src/commands.ts:10-17`. The return type catches field drift
  but not a missing variant: add a command to the sim and the harness still typechecks while silently
  rejecting it as invalid params.
- **`packages/sim/src/clock.ts` hides more than it reveals.** `Clock` is never used as a type,
  `createClock()` exists only so `state.ts:26` can write `createClock().tick` instead of `0`,
  `advanceTick` compiles by structural coincidence, and `TICKS_PER_SECOND` is exported and unused.
- **`divergenceAt` (`packages/harness/src/replay.ts:70`)** threads a sticky result through a
  pure-looking helper; an explicit check at the call site would read better.
- **`truncateToDepth` lives in `pointer.ts`** and has nothing to do with pointers.
- **The placeholder domain is wider than one file.** The analysis changelog tells slice 2 to delete
  `packages/sim/src/marker.ts`, but `commands.ts`, `events.ts`, `state.ts` (`markers` is a required
  field of `WorldState`), `sim.ts` (`Sim.create` spawns a marker) and the harness's `commands.ts` and
  `scenarios.ts` are all marker-shaped. Slice 2 replaces a vocabulary, not a file.

### Undocumented protocol deviations

These depart from `docs/wiki-map/06-stack-decision.md` without a recorded rationale. None is wrong;
they are now recorded in the analysis document instead.

- `session.new` returns `session`, not `sessionId`, and every session-scoped method takes `session` —
  while snapshots still use `snapshotId` and `fromSnapshotId`.
- `replay.verify` takes `{seed, commands, hashTrail?, expectedHash}` rather than `{path}`, and does not
  return `divergedSystem`.
- `rng.cursors` requires a `session` and returns the full `{hi, lo, draws}` cursor rather than a draw
  count per stream.
- `sim.runUntil` makes `equals` required and implements no `exists` predicate.
